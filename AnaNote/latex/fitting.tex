\section{Mass fits for signal and normalization}
\label{sec: fitting}

This section describes the fits to the invariant mass distribution of $\Bs\to\Ds\kaon\pion\pion$ and $\Bs\to\Ds\pion\pion\pion$ candidates after all selections are applied. 
The obtained yields are summarized in Tab. \ref{tab: SigYields}.

\subsection{Fit to $\Bs\to\Ds\pion\pion\pion$ candidates}
\label{subsec: NormFit}

An unbinned maximum likelihood fit is performed simultaneously to the invariant mass distribution of $\Bs\to\Ds\pion\pion\pion$ candidates, for 7 and 8 TeV data. 
As discussed in Sec. \ref{subsec: signalmodel}, the fit is given as the sum of the double Gaussian signal model, the sum of three bifurcated Gaussian functions to model the partially reconstructed $\Bs\to\Ds^{*}\pion\pion\pion$ background and an Exponential function to account for combinatorial background. The invariant mass distribution and the fit is shown in Fig. \ref{fig: BsDs3piFit}.

%The determined number of $\Bs\to\Ds\pion\pion\pion$ decays is $8496 \pm 102$ for 2011 data and $19410 \pm 160$ for 2012 data. 
%The determined yield for the partially reconstructed $\Bs\to\Ds^{*}\pion\pion\pion$ background is  (2011) $16904 \pm 299$ and (2012)  $38437 \pm 589$, 
%while the yield for the combinatorial background is (2011) $16066 \pm 304$ and (2012) $35285 \pm 596$.

The shape of the invariant mass distribution of$\Bs\to\Ds\kaon\pion\pion$ candidates is described by the sum of two double Gaussian functions for the $\Bz$ and $\Bs$ signal, 
two sums of three bifurcated Gaussians for the $\Bs$/$\Bz\to\Ds^{*}\kaon\pion\pion$ partially reconstructed background contributions and 
two sums of double Crystal Ball functions for the single misID $\Bs\to\Ds\pion\pion\pion$ and the partially reconstructed, misidentified $\Bs\to\Ds^{*}\pion\pion\pion$ decays. 
A simultaneous unbinned maximum likelihood fit is performed and the result is shown in Fig. \ref{fig: BsDsKpipiFit}.
