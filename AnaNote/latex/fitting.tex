\section{Massfits for signal and normalization channel}
\label{sec: fitting}

This section describes the nominal fits to the invariant mass distribution of $\Bs\to\Ds\kaon\pion\pion$ and $\Bs\to\Ds\pion\pion\pion$ candidates after all selection steps, described in the previous Sections, are applied. 
The obtained yields are summarized in Tab. \ref{tab: SigYields}.

\subsection{Fit to $\Bs\to\Ds\pion\pion\pion$ candidates}
\label{subsec: NormFit}

An unbinned maximum likelihood fit is performed to the invariant mass distribution of $\Bs\to\Ds\pion\pion\pion$ candidates. 
As discussed in Sec. \ref{subsec: signalmodel}, the fit is given as the sum of the double gaussian signal model, the sum of three bifurcated gaussians to model the partially reconstructed $\Bs\to\Ds^{*}\pion\pion\pion$ background, as well as an exponential to account for combinatorial background. The invariant mass distribution and the fit to it is shown in Fig. \ref{fig: BsDs3piFit}.

The determined number of $\Bs\to\Ds\kaon\pion\pion$ decays is $7173 \pm 115$ for 2011 data and $15640 \pm 151$ for 2012 data. 
The determined yield for the partially reconstructed $\Bs\to\Ds^{*}\pion\pion\pion$ background is  (2011) $13685 \pm 449$ and (2012)  $28702e+04 \pm 573$, 
while the yield for the combinatorial background is (2011) $12193 \pm 457$ and (2012) $25212 \pm 564$.

Fig. \ref{fig: BsDsKpipiFit} shows the invariant mass distribution of $\Bs\to\Ds\kaon\pion\pion$ candidates. 
A unbinned maximum likelihood fit is overlaid, which consists of two double gaussian models for the $\Bz$ and $\Bs$ signal, two sums of three bifurcated gaussians for the $\Bs$/$\Bz\to\Ds^{*}\kaon\pion\pion$ partially reconstructed background contributions and two sums of double crystal ball functions for the single miss-ID $\Bs\to\Ds\pion\pion\pion$ and the partially reconstructed, miss-identified $\Bs\to\Ds^{*}\pion\pion\pion$ decays. \newline
The extracted signal yields are (2011) $332 \pm  27$ and (2012) $787 \pm 39$.
