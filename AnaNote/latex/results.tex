\section{Results and summary}
\label{sec: results}

Using the definition of the branching ratio given in Eq. \ref{eq: BRwEff}, we compute from the measured yields and efficiencies:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathcal{B}(\Bs\to\Ds\kaon\pion\pion)}{\mathcal{B}(\Bs\to\Ds\pion\pion\pion)} = 0.051 \pm 0.002 \pm 0.003,
\label{eq: resultBR}
\end{equation}

where the uncertainties are statistical and systematical, respectively. \newline
The results are in good agreement with the first observation and BR measurement of the $\Bs\to\Ds\kaon\pion\pion$ decay, done with 1 $\invfb$ of 2011 LHCb data \cite{Blusk:2012it}.  
The number of signal events already exceeds one thousand candidates, allthough only the $\Ds\to\kaon\kaon\pion$ final state has been used for this analysis. 
Adding the $\Ds\to\pion\pion\pion$ final state, which is expected to contribute roughly 20 $\%$ of signal on top, makes this channel a promising prospect for a time-dependent $\gamma$ determination.
