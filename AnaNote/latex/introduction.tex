\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}

The weak phase $\gamma$ is the least well known angle of the CKM unitary triangle. A key channel to measure $\gamma$ is the time-dependent analysis of $\Bs\to\Ds\kaon$ decays [REF HERE]. \newline
The measurement of $\gamma$ presented in this note uses $\Bs\to\Ds\kaon\pi\pi$ decays, where the $\kaon\pion\pion$ subsystem 
is dominated by excited kaon states, such as the $K_{1}(1270)$ and $K_{1}(1400)$ resonances. 
It is complementary to the above mentioned analysis of $\Bs\to\Ds\kaon$, making use of a fully charged final state, where every track is detected in the vertex locator. 
To account for the non-constant strong phase across the Dalitz plot, 
one can either develop a time-dependent amplitude model 
%bin the phase space and develop a Dalitz model for each bin, 
or select a suitable phase-space region and introduce a coherence factor as additional hadronic parameter to the fit. \newline
This analysis is based on the first observation of the $\Bs\to\Ds\kaon\pion\pion$ decay presented in \cite{Blusk:1471393} and \cite{Blusk:2012it}, where its branching ratio is measured relative to $\Bs\to\Ds\pion\pion\pion$. 
The branching ratio measurement is updated
% and a measurement of $\gamma$ using the WHAT EVER approach is presented
, exploiting the full Run 1 data sample, corresponding to 3 $\invfb$ of integrated luminosity.
