\section{Decay-time fit}
\label{sec:timeFit}

This section covers the phase space integrated, time-dependent fit to $\Bs\to\Ds\hadron\pion\pion$ data.
We use the \textsf{sFit} technique \cite{Pivk:2004ty} to statistically subtract the background, leaving only the signal PDF to describe the decay-time. 
The \textsf{sWeights} are calculated based on the fit to the reconstructed $B_s$ mass distribution described in Sec.~\ref{sec:massFits}.
As additional input to the fit, the tagging information (Sec. \ref{sec:Tagging}), 
as well as the decay time acceptance (Sec. \ref{sec:Acceptance}) and resolution (Sec. \ref{sec:Resolution}) is used and fixed to the values obtained by the dedicated studies. 
Taking all inputs into account, the final time dependent fit PDF is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:TPDF_full}
\mathcal{P}(t,\delta t, q_{OS}, \eta_{OS}, q_{SS}, \eta_{SS}) \propto \left[ p(t^{'},\delta t, q_{OS}, \eta_{OS}, q_{SS}, \eta_{SS})  \otimes \mathcal{R}(t - t^{'},\delta t) \right] \cdot \epsilon(t)
\end{equation}
where $\int P(x,t,q_t,q_f) \text d$ is the PDF given by Eq. \ref{eq:PDF_intX}, $\epsilon(t)$ is the efficiency due to the time acceptance effects and $\mathcal{R}(t - t^{'})$ is the Gaussian time resolution function. 



\subsection{Fit to $\Bs\to\Ds\pion\pion\pion$ data}  

In the fit, the values of $\Gs$ and $\DGs$ are fixed to the latest PDG report \cite{PDG2016}. All tagging parameters are fixed to the central values found in the tagging calibration, described in Sec. \ref{sec:Tagging}.
Due to the fact that the $\Bs\to\Ds\pion\pion\pion$ decay is flavour specific, the CP-coefficients can be fixed to $C=1$ and $D_{f} = D_{\bar{f}} = S_{f} = S_{\bar{f}} = 0$, reducing Eq. \ref{eq:PDF_intX} to

\begin{equation}
\int P(x,t,q_t,q_f) \text d x = [\text{cosh} \left( \frac{\Delta \Gamma \, t}{2}\right) + q_t q_f \, \text{cos} \left( m_s \, t \right)] e^{- \Gamma t}.
\end{equation}

Note that in this case, the dependence on the coherence factor $\kappa$ is dropped and the same relation as found for $\Bs\to\Ds\pion$ decays is recovered. 
Therefore, the only free fit parameter left is $\dms$. The data distribution with the overlaid fit is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:tFitNorm}.

\subsection{sFit to $\Bs\to\Ds\kaon\pion\pion$ data}
The time-dependent fit to the sWeighted sample of $\Bs\to\Ds\kaon\pion\pion$ signal candidates is performed simultaneously in the four bins defined in Sec. \ref{subsec: AccComparison}, 
spliting the data into Run I \& II and trigger category 0 (L0Hadron TOS) \& 1 (L0Hadron TIS). 
In these four bins, the respective description of the decay-time acceptance (Sec. \ref{sec:Acceptance}) is used as an input. 
As further input the decay-time resolution scaling relation, found separately for Run I \& II in Sec. \ref{sec:Resolution}, is used in the simultaneous fit. 
The full fit model is given in Eq. \ref{eq:TPDF_full}, where $\int P(x,t,q_t,q_f)$ is: 

\begin{equation} 
           \int P(x,t,q_t,q_f) \text d x \propto    [
        \, \text{cosh} \left( \frac{\Delta \Gamma \, t}{2}\right) 
          + q_t q_f \, C \, \text{cos} \left( m_s \, t \right)  
          + \kappa \, D_{q_f} \, \text{sinh} \left( \frac{\Delta \Gamma \, t}{2}\right)  
          - q_t \, \kappa \, S_{q_f}\, \text{sin} \left( m_s \, t \right)  ]  e^{- \Gamma t}.
\end{equation}

Note that the integration over the available phase space $x$ gives rise to the coherence factor $\kappa$, which dilutes the sensitivity to the CP coefficients $D$ \& $S$ and with that, also to the CKM phase $\gamma$. 
All input parameters from the tagging, time acceptance and resolution are fixed in the fit. The CP coefficients, as well as $\kappa$, are therefore the only parameters left floating. 
The data distribution and the overlaid fit is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:tFitSig}.

%\subsection{\textsf{sFit} model validation using toy studies}
%The fit model and procedure is validated using pseudo experiments. 1000 toys are generated using the model described in Eq. \ref{eq:TPDF_full} and \ref{eq:PDF_intX}. 
%Each pseudo experiment is generated with the same amount of signal events found in the Run I + 2015/2016 data samples.  
%Figure \ref{fig:ToyPulls_tdfit} shows the pull distributions for all CP coefficients, where every pull P of a parameter x is given as $P = \frac{x_{gen} - x_{fit}}{\Delta x}$.
