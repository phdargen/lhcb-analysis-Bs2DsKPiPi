\section{Systematic uncertainties}
\label{sec:Systematics}

This section covers all relevant systematic uncertainties on the measured observables.
In particular, the model dependent description of the invariant $\Bs$ mass spectrum, the parametrization of the time acceptance using cubic splines, 
as well as the scaling of the time resolution and tagging calibration are potential sources of systematic errors. 
The largest contribution of systematic uncertainty is expected to appear in the choice of amplitudes entering the model to describe the 5 dimensional phase space, discussed in Section \ref{sec:fullFit}.

\subsection{Models for $\Bs$ mass distribution}
\label{subsec:SystMass}

The statistical subtraction of the residual background \cite{Pivk:2004ty}, left after the full selection, relies on the correct description of the invariant $\Bs$ mass distribution.
Since the choice of signal and background models is not unique, alternative descriptions which lead to slightly different yields for the signal and background components are available. 
The difference in yields could result in shifted values for the measured observables and are therefore treated as systematic uncertainty. \newline

\subsubsection{Signal model}

The Johnson's SU function which is used as nominal signal model is replaced by a double Crystal Ball \cite{CB}. 
The crystal ball model is given by a gaussian core with an exponential tail on one side. 
Choosing a double Crystal Ball allows for asymmetric tails in a slightly different way compared to the Johnson's SU function. 
Table xXx summarizes the observed differences in signal and background yields.

\subsubsection{Background model}

For the description of the partially reconstructed background, 
a combination of the RooHILLdini and RooHORNsdini model [REF HERE] is used instead of the nominal model of three bifurcated gaussians. 
The HORNSdini model is used to describe the $\Bs\to\Ds^{*}[\to\Ds(\piz)] X_{s/d}$ decay, where the brackets around the $\piz$ indicate that it is missed in the reconstruction. 
The $\Ds^{*}\to\Ds\piz$ decay is a Vector $\to$ Scalar-Scalar ($1^{-}\to 0^{-}0^{-}$) transition. 
Using the helicity of the $\Ds$, one can show that this results in a double-peak structure in the reconstructed $\Bs$ mass. 
Therefore, the HORNSdini shape consists of a gaussian-like double-peak structure:

\begin{equation}
HORNS(m_{\Bs}) = \int^{b}_{a} dm_{\Bs}\left(m_{\Bs} - \frac{a+b}{2} \right)^{2}\mathcal{DG}(m_{\Bs}\vert\mu,\sigma,f_{G})\left(\frac{1-\zeta}{b-a}m_{\Bs} + \frac{b\zeta - a}{b - a} \right),
\label{eq:HORNS}
\end{equation}

where a and b are the kinematic endpoins of the distribution and $\zeta$ is the positive, real fraction of the two peak hights. Additionaly, the shape is convoluted with a gaussian to account for resolution effects.

The HILLdini model parametrizes the invariant mass shape of $\Bs\to\Ds^{*}[\to\Ds(\gamma)] X_{s/d}$ candidates, where the $\gamma$ is not reconstructed.
Contrary to the previously discussed process, the $Ds^{*}\to\Ds\gamma$ is a Vector $\to$ Scalar-Vector ($1^{-} \to 0^{-} 1^{-}$) transition. 
From helicity arguments, the expected shape in the mass distribution of $\Bs$ candidates follows a parabolic curve without any peaking structure.
To accommodate for this shape, the HILLdini model consists of a parabolic curve between the kinematic endpoints a \& b: 


\begin{equation}
HILL(m_{\Bs}) = \begin{cases} -(m_{\Bs} - a)(m_{\Bs} - b),& \mbox{for } a < m_{\Bs} < b \\
 0, &  otherwise. \end{cases}
\label{eq:HILLS}
 \end{equation}

This shape is convoluted with the same gaussian resolution function used for the HORNSdini model.
The resulting differences in yields is shown in Table xXx. \newline


To study systematic uncertainties originating from the description of the combinatorial background, the nominal second order polynomial is replaced by an exponential function. 
The changes in signal and background yields after refitting with this alternative shape are shown in Table xXx. \newline

\subsubsection{Systematic effect on observables}

The shift of the central values of the observables in the full fit when using sWeights obtained from a combination of alternative models, 
as well as using only one alternative model for the signal/comb.background/part.reco.background and keeping the nominal model for the other parts,
is shown in Table yYy. We conservatively choose the biggest variation as systematic uncertainty from the modelling of the invariant $\Bs$ mass spectrum.
