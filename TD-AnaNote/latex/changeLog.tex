\begin{itemize}
	\item Version 1.0: First note draft circulated to the WG
	
	\item Version 2.0: Implemented first round of comments from Mark, Alessandro, Agnieszka
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Changed $D^0$ bkg vetoes (Sec.~\ref{ssec:vetoes}) 
		\item Revisited some systematics
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Use uncertainty from fake rate instead of fixing misID yield to 0 or twice the value (Sec.~\ref{subsec:SystMass})
				\item Use GLASS model instead of RBW as alternative to LASS model for $K\pi$ S-wave (Sec.~\ref{ssec:lineshapeSys}) 
				\item Instead of assuming pure phase space, 
					recalculate running width of three-body resonances taking only the dominant $K\pi\pi$ decay mode into account (Sec.~\ref{ssec:lineshapeSys}) 
				\item Calculate RMS of lineshape variations instead of summing them up in quadrature (Sec.~\ref{ssec:lineshapeSys}) 
				\item Bug fix in evaluation of fixed lineshape parameters (mass, width, form-factor) systematic (Sec.~\ref{ssec:lineshapeSys}) 
			\end{itemize}
		\item Added tables with alternative amplitude models (Sec.~\ref{ssec:altModels}) 
		\item Added comparison plots of 16 vs 17 data (Sec.~\ref{ssec:16vs17}) 
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Version 3.0: 
	\begin{itemize}
	
		\item Changed $D^0$ bkg vetoes back to the ones from v1.0 to account for additional Kaon misID (Fig.~\ref{fig:vetoD0}) 		

		\item Updated analysis with new MC samples   (Sec.~\ref{sec:Sim})
	
		\item Studied time resolution separately for 16 and 17 data (Sec.~\ref{ssec:ResRun2}) 		
		
		\item Changed phasespace acceptance method from BDT to MC integration (Sec.~\ref{sec:phasespaceAcceptance}) 

		\item Updated analysis with latest OS Tagger tuning   (Sec.~\ref{subsec: OScalibration}) 		
		
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Version 3.1:   Minor changes, approved by Mark and  Alessandro

	\item Version 3.2:   Updated fit validation of phasespace-integrated and full fit using the same data set (Sec.~\ref{sec:validation})

	\item Version 4.0:   Implemented first round of comments from Marta and Rafael
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Added a small section summarizing the main analysis steps (Sec.~\ref{sec:strategy})
		\item Small improvements to the formalism (Sec.~\ref{sec:Formalism}) and additional information on used lineshapes (Sec.~\ref{sec:AmpLineShapes})
		\item Additional information on fit stability and interference fractions (Sec.~\ref{a:ResoParas})
		\item Added additional systematic studies for the phase-space acceptance (Sec.~\ref{sec:SysPhspAcc})
		\item Added rough estimate of sensitivity to physical observables from phase-space integrated fit  (Sec.~\ref{ssec:timeFit})
		\item Added comparison of phase-space integrated and full time-dependent amplitude fit (Sec.~\ref{sec:Summary})
	\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
