INFO in constructor of NamedParameterBase:
  > For parameter named: "checkPID"
  > You did not provide a filename.
  > I'll read from stdin. This is completely OK,
  > but if there is no input from stdin ending in EOF,
  > the program will stall after this message.
  > If you find yourself in this situation, press Ctr-d.
  > In future, run the program as ./program < inputFile.txt
  > even if inputFile.txt is just an empty dummy file.
  > This message is only printed once.
