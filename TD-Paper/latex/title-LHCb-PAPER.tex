% Abstract -----------------------------------------------
\begin{abstract}
  \noindent \small
The measurement of the CKM angle $\gamma$, as well as the \CP-violating parameters in $\Bs\to\Dspm\Kpm\pion\pion$ decays, is reported.
For the measurement, a data set of $pp$ collisions, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 7 $\invfb$, recorded with the \lhcb detector, is used.
The CP-violating parameters are measured to be $C_{f} = y \pm Y \pm y$, $A^{\DG}_{f} = x \pm X \pm x$, $A^{\DG}_{\bar{f}} = x \pm Y \pm x$, $S_{f} = x \pm X \pm x$ and $S_{\bar{f}} = x \pm Y \pm x$, 
where the uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively. 
These parameters are used in combination with the world-average of the weak $\Bs$ mixing phase $\beta_{s}$, to obtain a model-independent meaurement of the CKM angle $\gamma$.
The measurement yields $\gamma = (2000^{+x}_{-a})\degrees$ modulo $180\degrees$, where the uncertainty contains both statistical and systematic errors.
A model-dependent measurement, using an amplitude model to describe the non-trivial phase-space of this decay, yields $\gamma = (1934^{+x}_{-a})\degrees$.
Using a sample of $\Bs\to\Ds\pion\pion\pion$ decays, found in the same \lhcb data set, the $\Bs$ oscillation fequency is measured to be $\dms = xx.xx \pm yy.yy \pm zz.zz$, 
where the uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively. \normalsize

%% Author List ----------------------------
%%  You need to get a new author list!
%\input{LHCb_authorlist.tex}
%
%The author list for journal publications is provided by the Membership Committee shortly after 'approval to go to paper' has been given.
%%It will be made available on the page
%%\verb!http://www.physik.uzh.ch/~strauman/forMemCo/LHCb-PAPER-XXXX-XXX/! .
%It will be sent to you by email shortly after a paper number has beens assigned.
%The author list should be included already at first circulation, 
%to allow new members of the collaboration to verify whether they have been included correctly.
%Occasionally a misspelled name is corrected or associated institutions become full members.
%In that case, a new author list will be sent to you.
%In case line numbering doesn't work well after including the authorlist, try moving the \verb!\bigskip! after the last author to a separate line.

%The authorship for Conference Reports should be ``The LHCb
%  collaboration'', with a footnote giving the name(s) of the contact
%  author(s), but without the full list of collaboration names.
