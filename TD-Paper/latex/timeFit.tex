\section{Decay-time fit to $\Bs\to\Ds\pion\pion\pion$ and $\Bs\to\Ds\kaon\pion\pion$ candidates}
\label{sec:timeFit}

The sFit technique~\cite{Pivk:2004ty} is used to statistically subtract the background from the $\Bs\to\Ds\pion\pion\pion$ and $\Bs\to\Ds\kaon\pion\pion$ data samples. 
During the fit procedure, $\Gs$ and $\DGs$ are fixed to the corresponding HFLAV~\cite{HFAG} world average.
The $\Bs$ production asymmetry $A_{p}$, defined as the relative difference in the production cross sections $\frac{\sigma(\Bsb) - \sigma(\Bs)}{\sigma(\Bsb) + \sigma(\Bs)}$, contributes with a factor $(1 \pm A_{p})$ to the signal PDF,
where the sign depends on the flavour of the b meson. 
For data recorded during Run I, $A_{p}$ is taken from~\cite{Aaij:2017mso}.
The PDFs used for the fits to the $\Bs\to\Ds\pion\pion\pion$ and $\Bs\to\Ds\kaon\pion\pion$ candidates are convolved with a Gaussian function representing the per-candidate decay-time resolution 
and multiplied by the decay-time acceptance described in Sections \ref{sec:Resolution} and \ref{sec:Acceptance}, respectively.\newline

Since the decay $\Bs\to\Ds\pion\pion\pion$ is flavour specific, the \CP coefficients defined in Equation xXx can be fixed to $C=1$ and $D_{f} = D_{\bar{f}} = S_{f} = S_{\bar{f}} = 0$. 
In the fit, the calibration parameters for the OS and SS taging algorithms, the $\Bs$ production asymmetry for Run II data, as well as the $\Bs$ oscillation frequency $\dms$, are measured.  
The fit to the decay-time distribution is shown in Figure \ref{fig:tFitNorm} and the measured observables are summarized in Table \ref{tab:normFitResults}.

The fit to $\Bs\to\Ds\kaon\pion\pion$ data is sensitive to a possible charge asymmetry of the kaon, introduced by its charge-dependent nuclear cross-section. 
Therefore, the detection asymmetry $A_{det}$ is introduced and multiplied as $(1 \pm A_{det})$, where the sign depends on the charge of the kaon, to the signal PDF. 
It is determined using a data-driven technique described in~\cite{Davis:2310213}.
The tagging calibration parameters are taken from the fit to the control sample and included in the fit using Gaussian-constrains.
The measured \CP coefficients are reported in Table \ref{tab:sigFitResults} and the fit projection is shown in Figure \ref{fig:tFitSig}.
